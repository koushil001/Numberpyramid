# Numbers Pyramid Puzzle Solver üß©‚ú®

Welcome to the **Numbers Pyramid Puzzle Solver**! This web app helps you find all possible 3-symbol combinations from 10 hexagonal inputs (A to J), where each input contains an operator and a number (like `+5` or `*2`). The solver calculates all valid combinations that match your target number, following proper operator precedence (BODMAS).

## How to Use üöÄ

1. **Enter the target number** you want to achieve in the **Target Number** input box.  
2. For each hexagon labeled **A** through **J**, enter a value in the format:  
   - An operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) **followed by** a number.  
   - Examples: `+5`, `-3`, `*2`, `/4`  
3. Click the **Calculate** button.  
4. The app will display **all valid 3-symbol combinations** (like `ABC`, `JFI`, etc.) that evaluate to your target number, respecting operator precedence.  
5. If no valid combinations are found, it will show a friendly message.

## Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Division is integer division (floors the result). Division by zero is skipped automatically.  
- Inputs must follow the operator+number format exactly to work correctly.  
- Only distinct letter combinations are checked (e.g., no repeats like `AAA`).
